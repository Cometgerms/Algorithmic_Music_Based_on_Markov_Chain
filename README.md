This project aims to utilize Max/MSP (MAX), combined with JavaScript codes, to develop algorithmic music based on Markov transition probabilities. Through this system, we may observe and analyze the transition between note and note and gain a deeper understanding of algorithmic music and probability systems. By introducing the Jitter module, the music generated is then visualized. The project also explores various potential applications, such as generative music composition and interactive music performance.
